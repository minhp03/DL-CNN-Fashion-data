Deep Learning Fashion Classifier
Project Overview

This project develops a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify fashion items from images.  employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to recognize various classes of fashion items such as coats, bags, t-shirts/tops, and sneakers.
Libraries and Tools Used

    TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
    NumPy and pandas: For data manipulation and handling.
    Matplotlib: For plotting training and validation results.
    ImageDataGenerator: For image data augmentation.
    Callbacks (EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint): For optimizing training process.

Model Performance

The CNN model exhibits a solid performance with a test accuracy of approximately 88.3%. The training process saw a steady increase in accuracy, reaching up to 90% for training data, which suggests effective learning and generalization capabilities.
